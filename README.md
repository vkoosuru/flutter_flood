# Flood prediction
Urban flooding is significantly different from rural flooding as urbanization leads to developed catchments. which increases the flood peaks from 1.8 to 8 times and flood volumes by up to 6 times, Consequently, flooding occurs very quickly due to faster flow times (in a matter of minutes). Urban areas are densely populated and people living in vulnerable areas suffer due to flooding, sometimes resulting in loss of life. It is not only the event of flooding but the secondary effect of exposure to infection also has its toll in terms of human suffering, loss of livelihood and, in extreme cases, loss of life Increasing trend of urban flooding is a universal phenomenon and poses a great challenge to urban planners the world over.
This project aims to address this issue by developing a mobile application that predicts the possibility of urban flooding and helps users take preventive actions.

**Technologies Used:**<br>

The following technologies have been utilized in this project:
Flutter: A cross-platform framework for developing mobile applications with a rich set of pre-built UI components and tools.

Firebase: A comprehensive platform provided by Google that offers various backend services such as authentication, database, and cloud messaging.

Machine Learning Models: Machine learning algorithms have been employed to train models using historical data and relevant parameters to predict the possibility of urban flooding.

**Usage:**<br>
1.Register and log in to the application using their credentials.

2.Provide relevant input which can be custom or you can even see previous years prediction using machine learning model of your choice.
